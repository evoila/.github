# Reusable GitHub workflows for the AWS BU

This repository hosts GitHub workflows to be used in the GitHub repositories of the AWS BU at evoila.

Sharing GitHub workflows:

- makes it easier to introduce automation to our projects; and
- lets us enforce best practices centrally.

To implement any of these workflows in a project, follow the [documentation from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows#calling-a-reusable-workflow).
